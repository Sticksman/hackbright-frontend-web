// String exercise 1
// A palindrome is a string that reads forwards and backwards the same.
// Cat is not a palindrome
// Ana is a palindrome
// racecar is a palindrome
// A man a plan a canal is a palindrome.
// Write a method that takes a string and determines whether or not it's a palindrome
//
//
// String exercise 2
// Write a function that takes a string and reverses it. You are not allowed to use string reverse.
//
//
// String exercise 3
// Write a function that takes a string and and a number and rotates it right.
// For example of I took cat and rotated it 1 then I would get tca. If I rotated it 2 I'd get atc.
//
//
// String exercise 4
// Write a function that takes two strings. Then figure out whether or not string 2 is a part of string 1.
// String 2 is a part of string 1 if the entire string is found in a single contiguous block.
// for example: race is in racecar, car is in racecar
//
//
// Array exercise 1
// Write a function that takes an array and another variable.
// If the element exists in the array, return its index. Else return -1
//
//
// Array exercise 2
// Write a function that takes an array. Reverse the array.
// BONUS: can you do this in place?
//
//
// Array exercise 3
// Write a function that takes an array and a variable. Add the variable to the end of the array.
// Hint: There's a builtin to do this.
//
//
// Array exercise 4
// Write a function that returns the last element of the array and removes it from the array.
// Hint: there's a built in to do this.
//
//
// Array and string exercise 5
// Write a function that takes a string. Split the string on every comma and add it to the list.
//
//
// Array and String exercise 6
// Write a function that takes an array. Join all the elements of the array together into a string, separated by commas
//
//
// Array exercise 7
// Write a function that takes two arrays.
// Then find the intersection between the two arrays.
// The intersection of two sets is defined as this:
// if you have set 1 with [1, 2, 3]
// and you have set two with [2, 3, 10]
// then the intersection is [2, 3]
// BONUS: Assume the two arrays are sorted. Does this change how you can do this problem?
// Part 2: write a union function
// A union between two sets.
// If you have set 1 [1, 2, 3] and set 2 [2, 3, 10]
// the union of the two sets is [1, 2, 3, 10]
//
//
// Object exercise 1
// Write a function that takes an object. Now return an array of all the keys in that array
//
//
// Object exercise 2
// Redo array exercise 7. This time inside the function use an object to help you with the intersection.
//
//
// Object exercise 3
// Write a function that takes an array of objects. Each object will have the following keys:
// {
//  title: 'foobar',
//  author: 'Toonces',
//  readingStatus: false
// }
// Now print out the title of every book along with its reading status
